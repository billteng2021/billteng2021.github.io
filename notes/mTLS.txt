Here is an example of how to create a CA and mTLS using OpenSSL Â²:

1. Create a private key for the CA:

```
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
```

2. Create a self-signed certificate for the CA:

```
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
```

3. Create a private key for the server:

```
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
```

4. Create a certificate signing request (CSR) for the server:

```
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
```

5. Sign the CSR with the CA:

```
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt
```

6. Create a private key for the client:

```
openssl genrsa -out client.key 2048
```

7. Create a certificate signing request (CSR) for the client:

```
openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr
```

8. Sign the CSR with the CA:

```
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out client.crt
```

These commands will create a CA and mTLS certificates for a server and client using OpenSSL. You can use these commands as a reference to create your own CA and mTLS certificates.
